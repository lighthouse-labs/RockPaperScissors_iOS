We have successfully created a fully functional Rock Paper Scissors game. During this process, we learned how to create an iOS app using Storyboards to setup the UI and Swift to add logic. 

Here is a link to a completed version of this project: <https://github.com/meech-ward/RPS>

If you want to continue creating iOS apps, here are some more resources from [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/)
